Examination #3 
2023 
Conceptual Short Answer (30 points): 
1.       Answer the following questions as concisely as   possible:
a)       You must design a heat pump   system   capable   of   creating   steam   at   1   atm.   Circle   or highlight   which working fluid you would examine first for use in your heat pump.

b)       In certain warm, humid areas, it will rain   every   day   shortly   after the   sun   goes   down.   Why?
c)          When considering the pairing a topping   cycle with   a bottoming   cycle   to   form   a   combined   cycle, what is the first aspect that   should be   considered?
d)       In a standard vapor-compression refrigeration system, why   do we use   a throttling valve   in   place   of   a   turbine?
e)       In a gas refrigeration   cycle, why   do we use   a turbine   instead   of   a   throttling   valve?
f)         In a refrigeration cycle, what is the purpose of   a regenerator? Does the addition   of   a regenerator boost system COP?
Combined Cycle (20 points): 
2.       A gas turbine – steam turbine combined cycle operates   at the   state points   defined   in   the table   and
diagram below. If   the combined cycle produces   100 MW, determine a) mass flow rates   of   water and air, and b) the system thermal efficiency. Assume constant   specific heat in the   gas   cycle using   a Cp=1.005 kJ/kg*K.

Refrigeration (25 points): 
3.       A refrigeration cycle is used to   18 kW refrigeration for a living   space   during the   summer.
The working fluid is Refrigerant   134a, and the pressures of   the evaporator and   condenser   are 20 and   100 psia respectively.
Note:You do not need to interpolate. Instead, take the average of the two closest values in a table. 
Determine the following:
(a)   Plot the T-s diagram for the refrigeration process   (b)   Complete the table below
(c)   Calculate the mass flow of   the Refrigerant   134a in lbm/min
(d)   Determine the work and heat energy transfers 代 写MAE 115 Applied Engineering Thermodynamics 2023 Examination #3Python

Psychrometrics(25 points): 
4.       Outdoor air at   1 atm is at   40oC   and   50% relative humidity.   Indoor   air   is   to   be   kept   at   22oC   and 40% relative humidity.
Determine the following:
a)      Fill out the table below for the outdoor and indoor air thermodynamic properties.
b)      Clearly state the name and order of   the processes required to move from   the   outdoor   air   properties to indoor air.
c)      Plot all thermodynamic processes required on the attached psychrometric chart.
d)      For a mass flow rate of 10 kgdry   air   per second, calculate the   total   heat   transfers   and   water   mass flow rates into and   out   of   the   air
(Extra Credit) If   the cooling and dehumidification process is accomplished   through   the use    of   a vapor compression chiller system, and there is an   absolute   difference   of   5oC between   the   air leaving the chiller and evaporator, and an   absolute   difference   of   5oC between   the   40oC outside air and condenser, what are the temperatures at   which the   evaporator   and   condenser   are operating?
